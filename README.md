1. For an application with a book service, realize the possibility of logging messages at various levels, providing for the possibility of using various frameworks for logging.
2. Develop a class to simulate a countdown clock that implements the ability to transmit a message and additional information about the event to any type that subscribes to the event after the appointed time (the waiting time is provided to the class by the user). Provide for the possibility of subscribing to an event in several classes. Demonstrate how the class works in a console application.
3. Implement a generalized binary search algorithm (do not use restrictions on the type parameter!). Develop unit tests.
4. Implement a method to generate a sequence of Fibonacci numbers
